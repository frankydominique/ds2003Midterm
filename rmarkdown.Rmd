## WORKSPACE PREP
* Data source:  

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Read in data
* `flights.csv`  
* `airports.csv`

```{r}
flights <- read.csv("/Users/stephaniefissel/Desktop/ds 2003/flights.csv")
airports <- read.csv("/Users/stephaniefissel/Desktop/ds 2003/airports.csv")
```

## Datasets

*Flights*  

A dataset with information about individual flights including:`DayofMonth`, `DayofWeek`, `Carrier`, `OriginAirportID`, `DestAirportID`, `DepDelay`, `ArrDelay`

```{r}
head(flights)
```

*Airports* 

A dataset with the `airport_id`, `city`, `state`, and `name` for 365 airports

```{r}
head(airports)
```

## REPORT OBJECTIVES

1. Determine how many airports are in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut (the tri-state area).
2. Visualize the average arrival and departure delays at each airport identified in Objective 1.
3. Analyze which carriers have the most and least departure and arrival delays.

## Objective 1

**Determine how many airports are in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut (the tri-state area).**

```{r}
# use dplyr to filter airports dataframe by states of interest
tristate_airports <- filter(airports, 
                              state == 'NY' | 
                              state == 'NJ' | 
                              state == 'CT')

# use n_distinct to count unique airport_id
n_distinct(tristate_airports$airport_id)
```

> In the states of NY, NJ, and CT, there are a combined **19** airports.

## Objective 2
**Visualize the average arrival and departure delays at each airport identified in Objective 1**

```{r}
# pivot data for viz

flights <- flights %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('DepDelay', 'ArrDelay'), names_to = 'delay_type', values_to = 'delay_min')

head(flights)
```

```{r}
colors = c(ArrDelay = '#a8dadc', DepDelay = '#219ebc')

p <- ggplot(flights, aes(delay_type, delay_min, fill = delay_type)) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge2', stat = 'summary', fun = 'mean') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
  ylab('Minutes') +
  xlab('Delay Type') +
  labs(
    title = "Average Delay by Departure and Arrival"
  ) + theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        legend.position="none") +
  coord_flip()

p

```
